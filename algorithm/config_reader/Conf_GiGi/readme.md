A standard configuration file consists of following 2 aspects:

	1.note:begin with '#' in each line
	2.item:consist of key and value linked by '=' without space

For instance:

Leave blank lines between two different items,for instance:

------------------------------------------------------
#This is a note of following item.
#This is also a note of following item.

#This is a note of following item.
#This is also a note of following item.
